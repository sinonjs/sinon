## Compatibility and supported runtimes

As of Sinon 10 we stopped maintaining compatibility with legacy browsers. Instead, we focus on compatibility with evergreen browsers, [Node.js LTS versions](https://github.com/nodejs/Release) and recent Safari versions.
The most up-to-date reference on which runtimes and browsers we support can be found by looking at our [compatibility docs][compat-doc].

If you need to support old runtimes you can try [Sinon 9][compat-doc-v9].
