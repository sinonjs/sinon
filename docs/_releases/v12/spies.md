### Introduction

### What is a test spy?

A test spy is a function that records arguments, return value, the value of
`this` and exception thrown (if any) for all its [calls][call]. There are two types of spies:
Some are anonymous functions, while others wrap methods that already exist in
the system under test.

### Creating a spy as an anonymous function

When the behavior of the spied-on function is not under test, you can use an
anonymous function spy. The spy won't do anything except record information
about its [calls][call]. A common use case for this type of spy is testing how a function
handles a callback, as in the following simplified example:

<div data-example-id="spies-1-pubsub"></div>

### Using a spy to wrap all object method

`sinon.spy(object)`

Spies all the object's methods.

Note that it's usually better practice to spy individual methods, particularly on objects that you don't understand or control all the methods for (e.g. library dependencies).

Spying individual methods tests intent more precisely and is less susceptible to unexpected behavior as the object's code evolves.

The following is a slightly contrived example:

<div data-example-id="spies-2-wrap-object-methods"></div>

### Using a spy to wrap an existing method

`sinon.spy(object, "method")` creates a spy that wraps the existing function
`object.method`. The spy will behave exactly like the original method
(including when used as a constructor), but you will have access to data about
all [calls][call]. The following is a slightly contrived example:

<div data-example-id="spies-3-wrap-existing-method"></div>

### Using a spy to wrap property getter and setter

`sinon.spy(object, "property", ["get", "set"])` creates spies that wrap the
getters and setters for `object.property`. The spies will behave exactly like
the original getters and setters, but you will have access to data about all
[calls][call]. Example:

```javascript
var object = {
  get test() {
    return this.property;
  },
  set test(value) {
    this.property = value * 2;
  },
};
var spy = sinon.spy(object, "test", ["get", "set"]);
object.test = 42;
assert(spy.set.calledOnce);
assert.equals(object.test, 84);
assert(spy.get.calledOnce);
```

### Creating spies: `sinon.spy()` Method Signatures

<dl>
  <dt><code>var spy = sinon.spy();</code></dt>
  <dd>
    Creates an anonymous function that records arguments, <code>this</code> value,
    exceptions and return values for all calls.
  </dd>
  <dt><code>var spy = sinon.spy(myFunc);</code></dt>
  <dd>
    Wraps the function in a spy. You can pass this spy where the original function would otherwise
    be passed when you need to verify how the function is being used.
  </dd>
  <dt><code>var spy = sinon.spy(object, "method");</code></dt>
  <dd>
    Creates a spy for <code>object.method</code> and
    replaces the original method with the spy. An exception is thrown if the property
    is not already a function. The spy acts exactly like the original method in
    all cases. The original method can be restored by calling
    <code>object.method.restore()</code>. The returned spy is the function
    object which replaced the original method. <code>spy === object.method</code>.
  </dd>
  <dt><code>var spy = sinon.spy(object, "property", types);</code></dt>
  <dd>
    Creates a spy for the property <code>object.property</code> which
    replaces the descriptor with an equivalent where each
    specified accessor (<code>types</code> parameter) has been
    wrapped as a spy. The returned object, unlike regular spies, is a
    property descriptor containing the wrapped accessors (spies).
    The original accessors can be restored by calling
    <code>spy.get.restore()</code> (where <code>get</code>
    is the accessor you wish to restore).
  </dd>
</dl>

### Spy API

Spies provide a rich interface to inspect their usage. The above examples showed
the `calledOnce` boolean property as well as the `getCall` method and the
returned object's `args` property. There are three ways of inspecting [call][call] data.

The preferred approach is to use the spy's `calledWith` method (and friends)
because it keeps your test from being too specific about which call did what and
so on. It will return `true` if the spy was ever called with the provided
arguments.

<div data-example-id="spies-4-pubsub-message-1"></div>

If you want to be specific, you can directly check the first argument of the
first [call][call]. There are two ways of achieving this:

<div data-example-id="spies-5-pubsub-message-2"></div>

<div data-example-id="spies-6-pubsub-message-3"></div>

The first example uses the two-dimensional `args` array directly on the spy,
while the second example fetches the first [call][call] object and then accesses its
`args` array. Which one to use is a matter of preference, but the recommended
approach is going with `spy.calledWith(arg1, arg2, ...)` unless there's a need
to make the tests highly specific.

## API

Spy objects are objects returned from `sinon.spy()`. When spying on existing
methods with `sinon.spy(object, method)`, the following properties and methods
are also available on `object.method`.

### Properties

#### `spy.withArgs(arg1[, arg2, ...]);`

Creates a spy that only records [calls][call] when the received arguments match those passed to `withArgs`. This is useful to be more expressive in your assertions, where you can access the spy with the same [call][call].

Uses deep comparison for objects and arrays. Use `spy.withArgs(sinon.match.same(obj))` for strict comparison (see [matchers][matchers]).

<div data-example-id="spies-7-with-args"></div>

#### `spy.callCount`

The number of recorded [calls][call].

#### `spy.called`

`true` if the spy was called at least once

#### `spy.notCalled`

`true` if the spy was not called

#### `spy.calledOnce`

`true` if spy was called exactly once

#### `spy.calledTwice`

`true` if the spy was called exactly twice

#### `spy.calledThrice`

`true` if the spy was called exactly thrice

#### `spy.firstCall`

The first [call][call]

#### `spy.secondCall`

The second [call][call]

#### `spy.thirdCall`

The third [call][call]

#### `spy.lastCall`

The last [call][call]

#### `spy.calledBefore(anotherSpy);`

Returns `true` if the spy was called before `anotherSpy`

#### `spy.calledAfter(anotherSpy);`

Returns `true` if the spy was called after `anotherSpy`

#### `spy.calledImmediatelyBefore(anotherSpy);`

Returns `true` if `spy` was called before `anotherSpy`, and no spy [calls][call]
occurred between `spy` and `anotherSpy`.

#### `spy.calledImmediatelyAfter(anotherSpy);`

Returns `true` if `spy` was called after `anotherSpy`, and no spy [calls][call]
occurred between `anotherSpy` and `spy`.

#### `spy.calledOn(obj);`

Returns `true` if the spy was called at least once with `obj` as `this`. `calledOn` also accepts a matcher `spyCall.calledOn(sinon.match(fn))` (see [matchers][matchers]).

#### `spy.alwaysCalledOn(obj);`

Returns `true` if the spy was always called with `obj` as `this`.

#### `spy.calledWith(arg1, arg2, ...);`

Returns `true` if spy was called at least once with the provided arguments.

Can be used for partial matching, Sinon only checks the provided arguments against actual arguments, so a call that received the provided arguments (in the same spots) and possibly others as well will return `true`.

#### `spy.calledOnceWith(arg1, arg2, ...);`

Returns `true` if spy was called exactly once in total and that one call was using the provided arguments.

#### `spy.alwaysCalledWith(arg1, arg2, ...);`

Returns `true` if spy was always called with the provided arguments (and possibly others).

#### `spy.calledWithExactly(arg1, arg2, ...);`

Returns `true` if spy was called at least once with the provided arguments and no others.

#### `spy.calledOnceWithExactly(arg1, arg2, ...);`

Returns `true` if spy was called exactly once in total and that one call was using the exact provided arguments and no others.

#### `spy.alwaysCalledWithExactly(arg1, arg2, ...);`

Returns `true` if spy was always called with the exact provided arguments.

#### `spy.calledWithMatch(arg1, arg2, ...);`

Returns `true` if spy was called with matching arguments (and possibly others).

This behaves the same as `spy.calledWith(sinon.match(arg1), sinon.match(arg2), ...)`.

#### `spy.alwaysCalledWithMatch(arg1, arg2, ...);`

Returns `true` if spy was always called with matching arguments (and possibly others).

This behaves the same as `spy.alwaysCalledWith(sinon.match(arg1), sinon.match(arg2), ...)`.

#### `spy.calledWithNew();`

Returns `true` if spy/stub was called the `new` operator.

Beware that this is inferred based on the value of the `this` object and the spy function's `prototype`, so it may give false positives if you actively return the right kind of object.

#### `spy.neverCalledWith(arg1, arg2, ...);`

Returns `true` if the spy/stub was never called with the provided arguments.

#### `spy.neverCalledWithMatch(arg1, arg2, ...);`

Returns `true` if the spy/stub was never called with matching arguments.

This behaves the same as `spy.neverCalledWith(sinon.match(arg1), sinon.match(arg2), ...)`.

#### `spy.threw();`

Returns `true` if spy threw an exception at least once.

#### `spy.threw("TypeError");`

Returns `true` if spy threw an exception of the provided type at least once.

#### `spy.threw(obj);`

Returns `true` if spy threw the provided exception object at least once.

#### `spy.alwaysThrew();`

Returns `true` if spy always threw an exception.

#### `spy.alwaysThrew("TypeError");`

Returns `true` if spy always threw an exception of the provided type.

#### `spy.alwaysThrew(obj);`

Returns `true` if spy always threw the provided exception object.

#### `spy.returned(obj);`

Returns `true` if spy returned the provided value at least once.

Uses deep comparison for objects and arrays. Use `spy.returned(sinon.match.same(obj))` for strict comparison (see [matchers][matchers]).

#### `spy.alwaysReturned(obj);`

Returns `true` if spy always returned the provided value.

#### `var spyCall = spy.getCall(n);`

Returns the _nth_ [call](../spy-call).

If _n_ is negative, the _nth_ call from the end is returned. For example, `spy.getCall(-1)` returns the last call, and `spy.getCall(-2)` returns the second to last call.

Accessing individual calls helps with more detailed behavior verification when the spy is called more than once.

<div data-example-id="spies-8-spy-call"></div>

#### `var spyCalls = spy.getCalls();`

Returns an `Array` of all [calls][call] recorded by the spy.

#### `spy.thisValues`

Array of `this` objects, `spy.thisValues[0]` is the `this` object for the first [call][call].

#### `spy.args`

Array of arguments received, `spy.args[0]` is an array of arguments received in the first [call][call].

#### `spy.exceptions`

Array of exception objects thrown, `spy.exceptions[0]` is the exception thrown by the first [call][call].

If the call did not throw an error, the value at the call's location in `.exceptions` will be `undefined`.

#### `spy.returnValues`

Array of return values, `spy.returnValues[0]` is the return value of the first [call][call].

If the call did not explicitly return a value, the value at the call's location in `.returnValues` will be `undefined`.

#### `spy.resetHistory();`

Resets the state of a spy.

#### `spy.restore();`

Replaces the spy with the original method. Only available if the spy replaced an existing method.

#### `spy.printf("format string", [arg1, arg2, ...]);`

Returns the passed format string with the following replacements performed:

<dl>
  <dt><code>%n</code></dt>
  <dd>the name of the spy "spy" by default)</dd>

  <dt><code>%c</code></dt>
  <dd>the number of times the spy was called, in words ("once", "twice", etc.)</dd>

  <dt><code>%C</code></dt>
  <dd>a list of string representations of the calls to the spy, with each call prefixed by a newline and four spaces</dd>

  <dt><code>%t</code></dt>
  <dd>a comma-delimited list of <code>this</code> values the spy was called on</dd>

  <dt><code>%<var>n</var></code></dt>
  <dd>the formatted value of the <var>n</var>th argument passed to <code>printf</code></dd>

  <dt><code>%*</code></dt>
  <dd>a comma-delimited list of the (non-format string) arguments passed to <code>printf</code></dd>

  <dt><code>%D</code></dt>
  <dd>a multi-line list of the arguments received by all calls to the spy</dd>
